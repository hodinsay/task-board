# Time Attask
Time Attask is a time customizable pomodoro timer that works on the computer browsers and mobile devices. The goal of this web app is to help users identify, prioritize, and complete their daily tasks in working time intervals with breaks. This web app is heavily inspired by the Pomodoro Technique, a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo, Eisenhower Matrix, a concept of prioritizing tasks formulated by President Dwight Eisenhower, and Pomofocus, a customizable pomodoro timer created by Yuya Uzu.
